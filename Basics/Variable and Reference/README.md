# Variables and References
This file mainly discusses variables and references and the ways of declaring them. When we declare a variable by giving a definition, the comiler would automatically create this variable and allocate memory space for it.

When we assign a value to this variable by using the assignment operator (=), the compiler would assign the value to the memory location represented by the variable.

This file also elaborates the syntax of applying the ideas of variables and references. For instance, if a fucntion requires a reference parameter, then the parameter has to be a L-value.




# References
This file particularly talks about references and its pros and cons. References are more efficient since they point to an existing memory location. However, it is also error-provoking since it will modify global variables in smaller scopes, mostly functions.





# Coding Philosophy
Use references when you need to, pointers when you have to.
